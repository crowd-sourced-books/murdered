This open source book is intented to be written by collaborators across the world. See something you don't like? Submit a pull request. Want to add some more details? Add that.

# Rules
This is not a gory story. Scenes not intended for children should be marked before they begin. 

# Plot?
Please feel free to contribute towards either the story plan or the written story. One day, the plot will be finalised so that the main manuscript can be written

# Who is this for?
This book is intented to be published to benefit the greater good. The proceeds will be spread among 10 charities, according to the wishes of the top 50 collaborators. As the top collaborator, I intend to reserve 5% of the royalties for a charity I choose.  I intend to make no money from selling this book, and intend to sign royalties over to the organisations chosen by the voters. This is a public piece of literature

# What langage?
This book is to be written in English. Final spellings will be in UK English (Colour not Color, Tyre not Tire, Autumn not Fall)

# Derivative works?
I mean, I can stop you but I think if anyone else published something substantially similar to this, it would devalue this original work. 

# What category of book is this?
No idea yet. The title so far is "Murdered". Could be anything. A whodunnit, a fictional history.

# Rules
It should not be a peer-reviewed scientific paper, or factual documentary, or an overtly political statement. Climate change is ok. NO real people. No caricatures that are obviously a person (e.g. no Donald Blump, no Queen Bessie the second of UK). I retain Benevolent Editorial Dictator position when decisions need to be made and there is significant disagreemnt. I retain a veto where two answers have 1/3 of the vote of the team.

# Why are you doing this?
Wouldn't it be interesting to have collaboratively written a piece of literature that will last forever. IF it is published in the UK, a copy will be preserved forever in 3 (or is it 4) national libraries in the UK. Your chance to be remembered.
